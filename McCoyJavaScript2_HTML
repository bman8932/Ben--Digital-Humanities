        Dear Mr Hunt
        
        Many thanks for your long and interesting letter which I was very pleased to receive.
        I am sorry I have been unable to answer
        it before but I have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately,
        and have had no opportunity of writing
        letters. Well I am very pleased to say I am feeling very fit and well, and quite enjoying the life. When writing to you last,
        I was attached to the 4th Division and was stationed at a small village where we were
        living in tents. We were stationed there
        about six weeks. Just over a week ago I was transferred to another place about eighty
        miles from the other one. I travelled by
        motor lorry with the Supply column and it took us all day from 7.30am till about 9
        o’clock in the evening to do the journey. It
        was a glorious trip, the scenery being very fine. Almost as good as our office outing,
        only not quite such comfortable travelling.
        We put up for the night in a small village, sleeping in the lorry with some empty
        petrol cans for a bed. Next morning I was taken to
        the railhead where I was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a
        week. While there we were all still sleeping in tents,
        but I was fortunate enough to have my meals with the Post Office Staff so have had
        a rest from being my own cook. Yesterday afternoon,
        just as I was going for my tea, I was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch
        a train to another railhead as I had to take charge
        as the A.M.F.O* for three Divisions there. As there is usually a man attached to each
        division, this was rather a large order. I only had
        about twenty miles or so to go, but it took from 5 o’clock till after 9pm to get there.
        These French trains are very rapid.
        I am now attached to the 51st (Highland) Division, the same division as <span class="persName">Williams;</span> a number of his lot were here
        today, but he was not with them. We shall probably only be here for a few days and
        will then move to another village further on. I was very surprised to hear of
        Mr <span class="persName">Pritchard</span>’s death. I also heard that Mr <span class="persName">Crossley</span> is also dead. We are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times.
        Glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section.
        I was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops
        that you are sending round the office and will
        certainly send you a photo later on. I have has some taken but have not received them
        yet. Have you heard from <span class="persName">Ferdie</span> or <span class="persName">Gray</span> at all?
        We all had our photos taken at  before we came out here a group of six. Unfortunately, I only had a few copies and
        they have
        all been sent away. <span class="persName">Ferdie</span> and <span class="persName">Gray</span> are still at the Base, I believe, but <span class="persName">Arthur Smith</span> is at one of the railheads somewhere. Well I don’t
        think I can tell you any more news at present. Will write again later and send photo.
        Kindest regards to all.
        
        Yours sincerely,
        <span class="persName">M.P. Pond</span>
